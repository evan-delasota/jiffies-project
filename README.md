This assignment showcases kernel module creation and deletion, as well as a preview of how proc files are created within these modules. <br />

#How to run:<br />
    1. Change directory to hello/jiffies/seconds<br />
    2. Run "bash \<filename\>.sh" to run a script file that builds the kernel module, and runs a few commands featuring the function of the module and it's respective process that is created. 
##Inside the script file<br /> 
    "sudo insmod <filename.ko>" (e.g. "sudo insmod seconds.ko"), this inserts the module into the kernel<br />
    "cat /proc/\<filename\>" displays the kernel module's functionality (e.g. "cat /proc/seconds")<br />
    "sudo rmmod <filename.ko>" removes the module from the kernel (e.g. "sudo rmmod seconds.ko")<br />
    "dmesg" verifies that the kernel module was loaded and removed properly.<br />
